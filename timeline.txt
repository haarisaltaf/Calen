Roadmap: AI Calendar App Development
---
lowkey i stopped using this pretty quickly cause it just made me stress about starting rather than starting. 
Need to delete but it might come in handy later if i dont have an idea of what to use for something or seomthing who knows

🧠 Concept:
An AI-assisted calendar app that intelligently schedules tasks, analyzes habits, reschedules missed events, and optionally runs locally for privacy.
⚙️ Phase 1: Planning & Design (Week 1)
Task	Description
🎯 Define Use Case	Choose target user (e.g., freelancers, ADHD users, students).[+]
📝 Write Feature Spec	Input Event, Static or Dynamic Event -- Reschedule Logic and Smart Suggestions [+]
🧩 Design Architecture	Choose local-first or hybrid; plan for modules: UI, AI engine, calendar logic, data storage.[ ]
🛠️ Pick Stack	Python (core), FastAPI (backend), SQLite (local DB), Tauri or Tkinter/PySide (desktop UI), optional JS if using Tauri.[ ]

🔧 Phase 2: Build the MVP Backend (Weeks 2–3)
Task	Description
🔌 Set up project structure	calendar_ai/, with api/, ai/, calendar/, ui/, db/, tests/ folders.
🧠 AI Module v1	Use OpenAI or transformers lib for task parsing: “Meet client next Tuesday” → datetime object.[ ]
📅 Calendar Engine	Add logic to: insert tasks, find free time, detect overload, reschedule with rules.[ ]
🗂️ Data Layer	Use SQLite + SQLAlchemy or TinyDB for fast local storage.[ ]
🔄 APIs	Create REST endpoints for adding tasks, querying schedule, getting suggestions. Use FastAPI.[ ]

🖥️ Phase 3: Desktop App with Basic UI (Weeks 4–5)
Task	Description
🖼️ UI Framework	Choose between Tauri (JS + HTML + Python) or Tkinter / PySide6 (pure Python GUI).[ ]
📆 Calendar View	Build simple calendar UI (week/month view), color-coded tasks.[ ]
➕ Task Input	Add natural-language input field → processes via AI → schedules task.[ ]
🧠 Suggestions Panel	"AI thinks you’re overloaded Tuesday—move X to Friday?"[ ]
💾 Local Saving	Save events + user responses locally, refresh UI on change.[ ]
📦 Package App	Use PyInstaller, briefcase, or Tauri build to create an installable version.[ ]

🧪 Phase 4: Local AI Integration (Weeks 6–7)
Task	Description
🧠 Add Local LLM Support	Use llama.cpp, Ollama, or transformers w/ small model (e.g., Phi-3 Mini, Mistral 7B Q4).[ ]
📦 Manage Models	Auto-download model or prompt user; add settings for local/cloud choice.[ ]
⚙️ Run AI on Device	Benchmark performance; allow fallback to OpenAI if resources are limited.[ ]
🔒 Add Privacy Toggle	Let users disable all external APIs. Emphasize offline privacy.[ ]

📲 Phase 5: Android Companion App (Weeks 8–10+)
Task	Description
🔄 Define Mobile Role	E.g., see today’s plan, add quick tasks, sync to desktop. Not full-featured yet.[ ]
📱 Choose Mobile Framework	Suggest Flutter (Dart, cross-platform) or React Native.[ ]
🔗 Create Sync API	Use FastAPI or Firebase to sync data between devices (or explore Syncthing, LiteFS, or local-only sync methods).[ ]
🔔 Push Notifications	Daily summaries, smart nudges (e.g., "Block 1 hour to finish invoice").[ ]
📤 Export/Import Tasks	Allow easy transfer of task data between mobile and desktop app.[ ]

🌍 Phase 6: Open Source & Monetization (Week 11+)
Task	Description
🔓 Open Source Core	MIT or Apache 2.0 license. Release on GitHub with README, setup, screenshots. [ ]
🧑‍💻 Developer Onboarding	Add contributing guidelines, Dockerfile for easy local dev, plugin architecture. [ ]
💵 Monetization Path	Free core, paid premium: sync, analytics, themes, integrations (Google Calendar, Notion, Slack). [ ]
🌐 Landing Page	Publish site with branding, demo video, GitHub links, pricing tiers. Use Carrd, Framer, or React. [ ]
🧩 Optional Features (Post-MVP) [ ]

Feature	Idea
📊 Personal Analytics	Weekly stats: deep work time, time wasted, context switching.[ ]
🧘 Mood Tracking	Daily mood + energy → influence task placement suggestions.[ ]
⏰ Energy-aware Scheduling	AI suggests best times based on past productivity patterns.[ ]
📅 Google Calendar Sync	Import/export to GCal using Google API.[ ]
🧠 Reinforcement Learning	Learn from user feedback (e.g., which suggestions they accept).[ ]
🛠️ Plugin Marketplace	Users/devs can build extensions for new task types or analytics.[ ]

📋 Tools to Use
Purpose	Tool
Backend API	FastAPI, Uvicorn
Local DB	SQLite + SQLAlchemy, TinyDB
Local AI	llama.cpp, Ollama, transformers
UI Desktop	Tauri (preferred), Tkinter, PySide6
Mobile	Flutter or React Native
Packaging	PyInstaller, briefcase, Tauri build
Version Control	Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions for CI
Analytics (optional)	Plausible, self-hosted or privacy-respecting

✅ Summary Timeline
Week	Focus
1	Define goals + architecture[ ]
2–3	Build backend AI logic + calendar engine[ ]
4–5	Desktop UI + MVP features[ ]
6–7	Add local AI, privacy toggle, performance tuning[ ]
8–10	Mobile app, sync, test across devices[ ]
11+	Launch open-source repo, grow community, monetize[ ]
